This enterprise search engine example program shows how to utilize [SAP HANA Search](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/691cb949c1034198800afde3e5be6570 "HANA search developer guide") which is part of both, cloud and on-premise shipments, of [SAP HANA DB](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html). It provides REST-APIs for search and CRD (create, read, delete) to process structured business objects and their relationships. To do so, it maps this business perspective to a technical perspective which is then processed by HANA. [SAP CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap) can be used to model the business objects and their relationships. The example also shows how to use the enterprise search UI which is delivered as part of SAP UI5. Programming language is Python.
