# SAP HANA Enterprise Search Engine
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/hana-enterprise-search-engine)

## Description
This example shows how to use [SAP HANA Search](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/691cb949c1034198800afde3e5be6570 "HANA search developer guide") to build a high-performance search-centric application on [SAP HANA DB](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html) (cloud or on-premise). It is written in Python and demonstrates how to:
- define separated data stores using a schema-based tenant concept
- define an object-oriented data model using a subset of [SAP CAP CSN](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/csn  "documentation")
- load data in JSON-Format
- search

via REST-APIs.

## Requirements
- Up-to date SAP HANA (on-prem or cloud)
- Latest version of [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "download")
- [SAP CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/ "getting started")

### Additional requirements for development
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "download")
- [SAP CDS language support for Visual Studio Code](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/tools/#add-cds-editor)
- Python linting as described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)


## Download and Installation
Clone or download this repository for example to c:\devpath\hana-search. 

Then open a console and change to the download path:
```bat
c:\ cd c:\devpath\hana-search
```

Create a python virtual environment named .venv:
```bat
c:\devpath\hana-search> python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the python virtual environment:
```bat
c:\devpath\hana-search> .venv\scripts\activate
```

If the environment is activated correctly, a previx (.venv) is shown in the command line:
```bat
(.venv) c:\devpath\hana-search>
```


Install the required Python packages:
```bat
(.venv) c:\devpath\hana-search> python -m pip install -r requirements/core.txt
```
Install additional Python packages if this installation is used for development:
```bat
(.venv) c:\devpath\hana-search> python -m pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```


### Configuration
Configuration is done with the config.py script using the following parameters
- --action install
- --db-host: The HANA host name
- --db-port: The HANA port number
- --db-setup-user: The HANA user name used for setup
- --db-setup-password: The HANA user password for the seup-user. Note: This user-name and passwords are not stored
- --db-schema-prefix: The prefix which is used for the schemas for this installation. E.g. HANA_SEARCH_\<myinitials>

```bat
c:\devpath\hana-search> python src/config.py --action install --db-host <<your_hana_host>> --db-port <<your_hana_port>> --db-setup-user <<your HANA admin user>> --db-setup-password <<your HANA admin password>> --db-schema-prefix <<your HANA >>

```
The configuration will create some HANA DB users and the src/.config.json file which contains configuration information and users and passwords created for the installation (needed e.g. for debugging purposes). Please do not change the src/.config.json file.

The default settings for the web-server (host 127.0.0.1 and port 8000) can be changed using parameters srv-host and srv-port.


To uninstall run the following command:

```bat
c:\devpath\hana-search> python src/config.py --action delete --db-setup-user <<your HANA admin user>> --db-setup-password <<your HANA admin password>>
```
Attention: This will delete ALL data of this installation!

### Start server
Start the server in the console with the activated virtual environment:
```bat
c:\ cd c:\devpath\hana-search
c:\devpath\hana-search> .venv\scripts\activate
(.venv) c:\devpath\hana-search> python src\server.py
```

The message "Application startup complete" indicates a successful server startup.

### Run end-to-end test

```bat
(.venv) c:\devpath\hana-search> python tests\test_suite\e2e_service_test.py
```


## Known Issues
This is an example application in an early stage of development:
- Don't store sensitive information because there is no access control
- Don't store personal information because of missing access logging
- Don't use the example application productively because users and passwords generated by config.py are stored plaintext in src/.config.json
- Make sure that system setup (tenent creation, post data model, post data) is completely automated as there is no migration provided between different versions of this example
