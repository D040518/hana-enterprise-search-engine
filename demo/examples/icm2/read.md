This is a example how to build queries on an ICM data model

Please consider the following notes to test the queries:
1. Configure your server configuration and then start server.py before you start with the queries
2. Begin always with "Initialize" within the notebook
3. If you add some queries it is possible that something is not going to run well. Please inform us in case of questions.


Following process should be executed firstly:
-> Setup.ipynb (For deletion of tenant use delete_tenant.ipynb)

Relevant notebooks:
-> simple_searches.ipynb: Shows simple requests on entities 
-> fuzzy_searches.ipynb: Shows incomplete parameter searches
-> complex_relation_searches.ipynb: Shows complex searches in several entities
-> geo_searches.ipynb: Shows locations searches with the result of latitude and longitude
